For 2014 he switched teams as well as machinery as he lined up for the Sky Racing Team VR46 on a KTM, and 2015 brought another new challenge with the new Aspar Team Mahindra. Ending the year as the top Mahindra rider, the Italian was also frequently involved in the podium battle, retaining his seat for 2016 and going on to take not only a maiden win in Assen, but also a second win in Sepang. Earning a test ride on the team’s MotoGP™ machine in Valencia at the end of the season, Bagnaia moved up to Moto2™ in 2017 with the new Sky Racing Team VR46 intermediate class effort and was Rookie of the Year, taking several podiums.

Unfortunately a broken leg sustained during a motocross training session saw him miss several races after Brno, with Morbidelli returning to finish the season but far from fully fit. For 2016 he signed with the highly successful Estrella Galicia 0,0 Marc VDS team and took an incredible run of podium finishes, ending the year just outside the top three in the title fight after an impressive campaign.

In a category that he competed in since 2019 alongside the Red Bull MotoGP Rookies Cup, he was a stand out rider in both competitions. In the FIM CEV Championship, he recorded podium finishes, while in the Rookies Cup he took runner-up, achieving three victories and five podiums, and second only to Carlos Tatay. 2020 saw him go one further and claim the Rookies Cup title before graduating onto the Moto3™ World Championship stage with Red Bull KTM Ajo. His impact in the class was instant, taking P2 in the season opener before going on to claim three consecutive victories, the best of which was a stunning ride from pitlane to P1 at the Doha GP. Suddenly he was the name on everyone’s lips and rumours of a direct move to MotoGP™ began to circulate. Three more victories and another podium saw the rookie seal the lightweight class crown but a move to the premier class never materialised, with Acosta instead opting for a seat in Moto2™. In his debut season in the class, Acosta made more history by becoming the youngest ever race winner with victory at Mugello. Two more wins and two more podiums helped him to fifth in the Championship and the Moto2™ Rookie of the Year title. He remained within the ranks of Aki Ajo’s KTM outfit and following seven wins, Acosta won his second title in three years with two races to spare. One of the most exciting talents we''ve ever seen now gets set for MotoGP™ with GASGAS Factory Racing Tech3 in 2024. What can the #31 achieve in his rookie season?'),
